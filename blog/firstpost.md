Hello world, as they say.
<br><br>
I'd like to give a big shoutout to [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), specifically because it's what compiles these blog posts from Markdown, but more generally because it's awesome.

I'll most likely be talking here about the various things I find, tricks I use, and of course, things I get up to. Feel free to read this, or don't. Yay for freedom.
