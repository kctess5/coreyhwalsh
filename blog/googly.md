This summer (2015), I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at [Google!](http://google.com) What this means, in short, is that I spending a lot of time with the good people at Google, making sure that everything is Googley.

I'll stop using that word now.

My building is in Los Angeles, so - once again - I'm in LA for the summer!

There may be more on this subject later... maybe.
