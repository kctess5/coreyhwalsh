<p class='down-2'>The 2.0 version of the algorithm. It is a predictive algorithm that monitors many frequency bands at the same time for \"local beats\" and then combines all of that information to detect \"global beats.\"<br><br>This version of the code (above) was used by Frog Design at the 2013 SxSW kickoff party.<br><br>Interested? Check out the source code on <a href='https://github.com/kctess5/Processing-Beat-Detection' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>

<p class='down-2'>The earlier iteration of the algorithm. Basically just an implementation of the Minim audio analysis library.</p>
