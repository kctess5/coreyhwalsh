<p>Hands down my favorite pair of speakers I've built so far. They sound just as good as they look.</p>
<img class='down-1 full-width shadow' src='/assets/aikos.jpg'>
<p class='down-1'>The drivers are FE108E-Sigma's modified by <a href='http://www.planet10-hifi.com/' target='_blank'>Planet-10</a> and purchased used (off of the Dave himself). The enclosures are back loaded horns called Aikos from the <a href='http://www.frugal-horn.com/spawn.html' target='_blank'>Spawn family</a> of designs.<br><br>I used patinated copper veneer for the baffle and zebrawood veneer covers the front, top, and back. The sides are about 8 coats of high gloss black paint, sanded from low to high grit between every coat and then buffed.<br><br>These speakers are paired with the <a class='meta' href='#projects/sofa-sub'>Sofa Subwoofer</a> for earth-shattering bass.</p>
