<p>Imperfect but lovable line arrays that was my first real build. The woofers are Tang Band something-er-others that were once upon a time on Parts-Express buyout. These things go loud! They performed admirably as the main sound system at an outdoor dance party (with some help from a MASSIVE Brahm Exodus Anarchy-powered sealed subwoofer).</p>
