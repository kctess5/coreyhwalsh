Hello world, as they say.  
  
I'd like to give a big shoutout to [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), specifically
because it's what compiles these blog posts from Markdown, but more generally
because it's awesome.  
  
I'll most likely be talking here about the various things I find, tricks I
use, and of course, things I get up to. Feel free to read this, or don't. Yay
for freedom.
