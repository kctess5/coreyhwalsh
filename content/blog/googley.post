This summer (2015), I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at
[Google!](http://google.com) What this means, in short, is that I spending a
lot of time with the good people at Google, making sure that everything is
Googley.  
  
I'll stop using that word now.  
  
My building is in Los Angeles, so - once again - I'm in LA for the summer!  
  
There may be more on this subject later... maybe.
