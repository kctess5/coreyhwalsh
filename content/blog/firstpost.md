Hello world, as they say.
<br><br>
I'd like to give a big shoutout to [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), specifically because it's what compiles these blog posts from Markdown, but more generally because it's aweseome.
 
I'll most likely be taking here about the various things I find and tricks I use. Feel free to read this, or don't. Yay for freedom.
