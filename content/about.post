<h1 class="title">About</h2>
<p class='down-2'>Hi there! I'm Corey. I like to make things, learn things, and break things. I have a bad habit of building speakers, and can't wait until cars are autonomous. You'll usually find me in California, though I tend to wander around.</p><img class='down-1' src='/assets/drawing.jpg'>

<h2 class='subtitle'><span class='mred'>MIT</span> - 2013 to Now</h2>
<p>I'm a Junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science and Engineering, and graduating in May of 2017. Right now, I'm working on learning all about machine learning and computer vision.</p>
<h2 class='subtitle'>La Costa Canyon - 2009 to 2013</h2>
<p>I attended La Costa Canyon High School in lovely Carlsbad, California. While I was there, I made <a class='meta' href='#projects/stadium-sound'>an astonishingly loud sound system</a> for the football field.</p>

<p>I architected, proposed, and initiated the refactoring of a large and complex codebase, handling billions of requests per day. The changes improved the maintainability of the system by reducing code duplication and complexity, and by facilitating fine grained unit testing.</p>

<h2 class='subtitle'><span class='hgreen'>Hulu</span> - Summer 2014</h2>
<p>I created a metadata generation service in Python which is still in use today. If you've seen a Google search result for a Hulu video recently, my system created that text!</p>
<p>In addition to my project, I helped to maintain Hulu's existing web systems and front-ends. <a href='http://www.hulu.com/about/executive_team' target='_blank'>Check out that random web page I made!</a>

<h2 class='subtitle'><span class='mcred'>MeringCarson</span> - Summer 2013</h2>
<p>Between high school and college, I was one of three developers at MeringCarson, a small but loud branding/design/marking firm in San Diego. I got my hands very dirty with front end technologies and PHP creating a custom content management system and making pixel-perfect versions of Photoshop designs.</p>

<h2 class='subtitle'>Mikey's Run - 2013 to 2014</h2>
<p>In 2013, a fellow MIT student and I launched Mikey's Run, a fundraiser to benefit victims of the Boston Bombing. We raised around $230,000 which went to support the long term medical needs of those affected.</p>
<h2 class='subtitle'>Del Mar Fair - Summer 2013</h2>
<p>I worked in the Student Showcase helping to set up the exhibit, and then interacting with guests to provide the best experience possible.</p>
