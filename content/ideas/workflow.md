<p>Imagine that if when you Control-click a sublime file, the ones related to it open. I picture this being useful for things like Backbone.js, where you have models, views, styles, templates, etc all for related components. If when I clicked on a UI element's model, all of it's related files opened up, that would be awesome. There's probably already something similar to this, so I need to spend a bit of time searching.</p>
