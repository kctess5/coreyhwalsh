			"<p class='down-1'>I've wanted to do something with some sort of collaborative edit algorithm for a while now, and I've finally gotten around to doing it. I settled on Google MobWrite because it looks like one of the most powerful options on the market. I originally thought Share.js, but the support for that project, frankly, sucks, so it's not too enticing from that aspect and the code itself doesn't seem quite as thought out as MobWrite.</p>",
			"<p class='down-1'>Unfortunately, MobWrite doesn't have a Python client library, so I've had to start this whole processing by porting code from the Java and Javascript client stuff. Documentation is a bit lacking, so it's been slow going with lots of ? moments, but this process is almost done. Once I finish it, I will just have to write a bit of UI stuff to let users decide what parts of their code they want to share, and the code to make that acutally work.</p>"

			"<p class='full-width down-1'>I recently got sick of not building speakers, so I decided to have another go at it and make my desk a nice setup. I wanted something that was small(ish), could work without a subwoofer, and wasn't too expensive. I've always wanted to use the venerable <a class='blue' target='_blank' href='https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-4-fullrange/markaudio-alpair-7a-gold-cone-4-full-range/'>Mark Audio Alpair 7.3</a>; considering their price and reputation for making good bass I decided that it was time. <br><br> I've made <a class='blue' target='_blank' href='http://www.coolcat.dk/bjoern/TABAQ%20BOX%20Cabinet%20build.pdf'>this specific cabinet design</a> before, so I immediately thought of pairing it with the Alpairs. Shout out and many thanks to Bj√∏rn Johannesen! A small amount of internet sleuthing later I convinced myself that that was the right choice, and modeled it in SolidWorks. Turns out waterjetting MDF is NOT such a great idea...</p>",
