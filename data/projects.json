			"<p class='down-1'>I recently got sick of not building speakers, so I decided to have another go at it and make my desk a nice setup. I wanted something that was small(ish), could work without a subwoofer, and wasn't too expensive. I've always wanted to use the venerable <a class='blue' target='_blank' href='https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-4-fullrange/markaudio-alpair-7a-gold-cone-4-full-range/'>Mark Audio Alpair 7.3</a>; considering their price and reputaion for making good bass I decided that it was time. <br><br> I've made <a class='blue' target='_blank' href='http://www.coolcat.dk/bjoern/TABAQ%20BOX%20Cabinet%20build.pdf'>this specific cabinet design</a> before, so I immediately thought of pairing it with the Alpairs. Shout out and many thanks to Bj√∏rn Johannesen! A small amount of internet sleuthing later I convinced myself that that was the right choice, and modeled it in SolidWorks. Turns out waterjetting MDF is NOT such a great idea...</p>",
